# weather-app

A web application which dynamically displays the present weather at the user's favourite locations around the globe, from an array of locations which is persisted in local storage. Features a clickable unit display, which will convert the displayed temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and back. Handles unsuccessful API calls by alerting a message to the user.
The project used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Webpack, and OpenWeatherMap API.

## Lessons Learned

Was the first project I've ever made which consumes an external API - learned a lot about using async JavaScript (including Promises, async/await, fetch API and error handling).

First time working with JSON files, picked up extracting info from a JSON data structure and destructuring from this project.

## Potential Future Features

- Adding a feature which adds a relevant image for different weather descriptions.

## Deployment

Deployed with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Get started

No dependencies - to run locally, open the project directory with VSCode. Install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) (if you haven't already) and click "Go Live" in the blue bar at the bottom of the screen. This will open a live development server in your browser that updates in response to code changes.
